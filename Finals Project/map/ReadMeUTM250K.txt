GeoTIFF Details
==============================================================================

The GeoTIFF is a 24 bit True Colour TIFF (3 X 8 bit bands - Red, Green, and 
Blue) with geographic tags that supply both world file co-ordinate information 
and projection specific parameters.  This GeoTIFF has a 2m pixel size, and 
covers an area 16.5km X 13.5km, centered on a 1:250,000 map sheet.  The image 
provides collarless coverage, and therefore has an overlap with the 
surrounding map sheets.

Map cartography is based on a subset of features as shown in the legend of the
1:20,000 Topographic Map files available from:
http://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/dmf-viewer/?siteid=5628311639164388216.
